Plan to get this to work.

* First - is there some higher level way to get to this on windows? The build deps are the bottleneck for anybody, vagrant/docker can't do windows.
    * Yes - node-ffi.
* If not - start breaking down ways to attack the issue.

## Node FFI plan

What deps does node-ffi need?
SerialPort isn't using it (directly).
Oh - that needs the VCBuild stuff too.

## Start attacking the not compiling

npm  building should work here. How can I get it.

* Windows 10 SDK did NOT have the right binaries. 
* npm-rebuild does nothing that useful.

SEtting this as install script in package.json:

    "install": "node-pre-gyp install --fallback-to-build --runtime=electron --target=1.1.0 --target_arch=x64 --directory=node_modules/serialport/ --update-binary --dist-url=https://atom.io/download/atom-shell",
(As per the link above)

Now trying the npm install gives this:

    > Electron-Serial-Experiment@0.1.0 install C:\Users\danny\Source\Repos\bounce_all_versions\electron_serial_experiment
    > node-pre-gyp install --fallback-to-build --runtime=electron --target=1.1.0 --target_arch=x64 --directory=node_modules/serialport/ --update-binary --dist-url=h
    ttps://atom.io/download/atom-shell

There is more but I think this VCBuild is what we need next.
Lets try the .net framework SDK then - I didn't see vcbuild.exe in my system anywhere.

Woah - vscode C++ support - what did it just do? Have I just gotten an easy C++ Compiler here?
No - wishful thinking. Ok.

Carry on that SDK download - V2.0 - see what it does for me.
No forget that - THIS IS BETTER:
https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#prerequisites

Global install of windows build tools. - it built.

Will it run?
Still get the dll error.
What happens if I take target out?

NO.
Okay lets remove extra crud from package:
    "scripts": {
        "rebuild" : "electron-rebuild -f -w serialport",
        "install": "node-pre-gyp install --fallback-to-build --runtime=electron --target=1.4.5 --target_arch=x64 --directory=node_modules/serialport/ --update-binary --dist-url=https://atom.io/download/atom-shell",
        "start": "electron main.js"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "electron-rebuild": "^1.4.5",
        "node-gyp": "^3.3.1",
        "node-pre-gyp": "^0.6.28"
    },

Then lets clean out node_modules.
Now run npm install.

Now the serial port guide for electron - https://github.com/EmergingTechnologyAdvisors/node-serialport#electron says this:

    npm install --save-dev electron-rebuild

Next - add the rebuild to the install hook:

    "scripts": {
        "install": "electron-rebuild"
    },

Now do "npm install" - this may have done a build.
Now try "npm start". Ah - no start command.
Need to add this back:

    "start": "electron main.js"

It's alive!!
