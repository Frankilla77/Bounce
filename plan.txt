Install Node + NPM on my windowss box.

* Start following this:
http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/
* Get a simple app to run.
* Get the serial native extension to work - documenting how.
    - Use an arduino with simple known 9600 code first - we can get more elaborate later.
* Get this to work on a VM runing linux.
* Get this to work on Carol's mac.
* Keep the results documented and source controlled.
* Try to use gulp/grunt tasks for the build processes - 
so it can be automated as much as possible.
* Get the windows AppVeyor demo version running.
* Get linux travis and osx travis working.
* Use this to reboot bounce.
