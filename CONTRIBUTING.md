Bounce is intended to make the possibilty of WiFi IoT programming and cheap microcontrollers available to children or people who are not familiar with text based programming languages. It maintains a code-view and export functionality to assist this.

Contributions will be checked, and merged - made in the form of pull requests. Please do raise issues, and although they will be read, as this is an entirely voluntary project, they may take time to be fixed.

The project has a roadmap, of the changes that the author (and community) potentially think will be done next or have the most benefit, but don't feel that you need to contribute according to this list, if you are able to help - with documentation, examples, fixing the blocks or in some way making this a better project, you are encouraged to do so. It is by contributions of code that this project can flourish.

On a side note - cross pollination with related projects, such as EduBlocks and Scratch are encouraged.
