To use this as a developer:
* Clone it from git.

You will need to load this in chrome as a developer extension. 

Launch the app this way: 
https://developer.chrome.com/apps/first_app#five - pointing it at the Bounce directory.

Changing libraries

If you need to change the goog dependancies, or blockly version this is a bit trickier. 
You will need standard gnu loadout + a jre. Use GOW on windows.

Use update_libs.sh - and then you will need to commit the compressed output.
