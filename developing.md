To use this as a developer:
* Clone it from git.
* If you are on windows - read the instructions at the top of build.sh (dockerfile alternative coming).
* Run build.sh

You will need to load this in chrome as a developer extension. 

Launch the app this way: 
https://developer.chrome.com/apps/first_app#five - pointing it at the Bounce directory.
